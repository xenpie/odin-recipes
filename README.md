# Odin Recipes
This is my first project as part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course.
The goal is to create a basic recipe website in plain HTML.

## Post-completion reflection
With this project I have demonstrated that I am able to build a static website using basic HTML elements such as headings, anchors, lists, and image tags.
